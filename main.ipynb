The other 10 percent go I private schools, which often include religious education. They are similar to the public schools but parents must pay for their children to go to these schools.

The amount of money spent on education differs from state to state. The subjects studied also differ a little. The school year usually runs from September to June. At the high school level, there are some specialized schools. They include schools that emphasize vocational subjects like business or auto mechanics. Most high schools are general schools. High school students are often involved in the non-academic activities that their school offers -for example, in drama clubs, sports teams, or the school newspaper.\n","\"\"\"\n","# Разбор
